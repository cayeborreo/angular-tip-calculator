# Frontend Mentor - Tip calculator app solution

Hi! 👋 This is a solution (I submitted it [here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/tip-calculator-solution-using-angular-and-bulma-oyEfCiAKC)) to the [Tip calculator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## 🤔 Quick note: Why this project?

I'm currently looking for work opportunities, and I see that most of the roles for web dev (if not [React](https://reactjs.org/), which I'm already familiar with) actually use [Angular](https://angular.io/start)! So I wanted to try my hand at it.

At the same time, I'm expecting frontend challenges and tests soon, so I Googled that—"frontend challenges"—and came across Frontend Mentor. It's the perfect place to look for project starters. Sure, I finished the Angular sample cart app, but getting my hands dirty on this calculator app _really_ made me review Angular concepts and how-to's.

It is by no means perfect! That's why this repo is up here—for a show-and-tell, and of course, getting feedback on how I can improve 🤗

## ⚡️ Running the project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.1.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
